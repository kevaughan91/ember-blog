We decided to drive, and started our trip by stopping in Savannah, GA, for an evening, and then making the rest of the drive to Miami. Overall, the city had so much to take in, but we were surprised by how expensive drinks and food were in the city. There were so many cool sites and places to see, one week hardly seemed like enough time to see everything.</p><p class=\"post--subtitle\">WHere we stayed:</p><p>We stayed at the oceanfront Palms Hotel on Collins Ave. I can honestly say it was a gorgeous hotel, and they clearly go above and beyond taking care of the grounds. It was complete with 2 resturants, 3 bars, and a pool sourrounded by tiki cabanas, palm trees, and loungers. There were two parrots that live on the premises which was a nice wel;come as you enteted the pool area each day. </p><img src=\"/assets/images/miami4.jpg\"><img src=\"/assets/images/miami2.jpg\"><img src=\"/assets/images/miami5.jpg\"><img src=\"/assets/images/miami3.jpg\"><img src=\"/assets/images/miami1.jpg\">",
