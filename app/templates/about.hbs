Hey! Welcome to Trend & Tonic!

My name is Kelly Rainwater, and I'm from Raleigh, NC. I work as a Software Developer, 
while also pursuing my other interests of decor and fashion.

I went to school at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, and got my degree in Computer 
Science with a minor in digital arts and graphics. I met my husband, James, while I was in 
school there, and we just got married in September of 2017. Now we both live in Raleigh with 
our little pup-child, Zoey.

I started this blog because I love spending my weekends crafting projects for around the home,
and of course shopping! I frequently get questions from friends and family about
where I got certain decor items, or how I made signs hanging on the walls of the home, or 
where I find some of my outfits I wear - So I figured Id just start a blog and put it all out there!

Maybe no one will read it, or maybe everyone will, either way, I love getting the chance to 
share some of things I enjoy with others!

Happy Reading!
